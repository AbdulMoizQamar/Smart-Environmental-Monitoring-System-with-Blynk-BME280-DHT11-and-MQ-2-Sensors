# Smart-Environmental-Monitoring-System-with-Blynk-BME280-DHT11-and-MQ-2-Sensors
This project uses an ESP32 to monitor temperature, humidity, pressure, and gas levels with BME280, DHT11, and MQ-2 sensors. Data is sent to Blynk for real-time monitoring, with a remotely controlled buzzer for gas level alerts.
